# Machine Learning Titanic

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for applying various machine learning algorithms to the Titanic dataset. The goal is to predict survival outcomes for passengers on the Titanic and includes a submission file that can be used to participate in the Titanic competition on Kaggle.

## Notebooks

### 1. Logistic Regression
- File: [Logistic_Regression.ipynb](notebooks/Logistic_Regression.ipynb)
- Description: This notebook demonstrates the implementation of logistic regression for predicting Titanic passenger survival. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

### 2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- File: [SVM.ipynb](notebooks/SVM.ipynb)
- Description: This notebook showcases the application of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Titanic dataset. It covers SVM model creation, parameter tuning, and performance assessment.

### 3. Decision Tree Classifier
- File: [Decision_Tree.ipynb](notebooks/Decision_Tree.ipynb)
- Description: In this notebook, a Decision Tree classifier is used to make survival predictions based on Titanic dataset. It explores tree visualization and fine-tuning of hyperparameters.

### 4. Voting Classifier
- File: [Voting_Classifier.ipynb](notebooks/Voting_Classifier.ipynb)
- Description: The Voting Classifier notebook demonstrates ensemble learning by combining predictions from multiple models, including Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Tree, to improve overall prediction accuracy.

## Kaggle Competition Submission
- File: [titanic_submission.csv](submissions/titanic_submission.csv)
- Description: This CSV file contains the predictions generated by one of the notebooks (e.g., Voting Classifier) for submission to the Titanic competition on Kaggle.
